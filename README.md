# Site Bay SDK
Interested in creating your own White Label web design business hosted by us? 
Buy an Agency Plan! It comes with an API Key which you can use to automatically deploy sites for your customers.
A full list of API functions can be found at [API Documentation](https://my.sitebay.org/docs)
Sites created for your Agency team will automatically add a Starter sub-plan to your agency plan. Starter plans cost 25 USD and add 20 GB storage and 30000 visits (per month per site). These sub-plan resources will be pooled across your agency plan. If you delete a site, you will still get the prorated resources for your Agency plan and will only be charged the prorated cost for your Starter sub-plan.

Charge your own prices and get all of Site Bay's features.

## Pricing

For example, if you have 10 sites on your agency plan, you will be charged $99 Base plan fee + $25 * 10 Per site fee = $349 Total fee.
